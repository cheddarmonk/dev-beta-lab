## Let's Git Into It!

## Heroku
The first thing to do is to set-up your very own Heroku account by finishing the sign-up process here: [Heroku's Website.](www.heroku.com) ![Login](images\Capture1.PNG)

* Click on the Sign up option and follow the process to completion. 
* Congrats next on to connecting your GitHub project to Heroku!


## Your First App
* Once you have logged in to Heroku you should be at a page like this ![Dashboard](images\Capture2.PNG)
* Click on the *New*  button on the top right and select New App
* Enter your app's name and create the app
* You will be brought to a dashboard and under the heading *Deployment Method* you will see a button that will allow you to connect to your GitHub account!

* Clicking the button will open a new window allowing you to enter your GitHub Account info. 
* After you login to your Github there you should go back to your dashboard and be able to select which GitHub Repository you would like for Heroku to connect to

* After finding which repo to connect to, click on the connect button. Heroku then will automatically connect and copy over all the information in that repo!

* **ONE FINAL THING HERE!** After you connect be sure to Enable Automatic Depolys so that any changed we make later can be automatically made here!
